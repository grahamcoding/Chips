# The Salty Snack Sales Tool (3ST)

An example of a minimal, useful and purpose built React app. In this instance, the app is designed as a tool to help a snack product salesperson plan out and sell in a point of display feature. The app is designed to quickly and easily generate a visual representation of the display and give the relevant profit margins to share with a store manager. 

## Tools

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The project is built fully in React, using react-bootstrap for simple design elements and Javascript for calculations and app features.
